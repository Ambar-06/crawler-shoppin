# Approach to Identifying Product URLs

This document outlines the methodology used to identify product URLs on e-commerce websites.

## Challenges

Identifying product URLs across different e-commerce platforms presents several challenges:

1. **Varying URL patterns**: Different platforms use different URL structures (e.g., `/product/`, `/p/`, `/item/`)
2. **Dynamic content loading**: Many sites use JavaScript to load products
3. **Pagination**: Products may be spread across multiple pages
4. **Anti-scraping measures**: Websites may implement measures to prevent crawling

## Our Approach

### 1. URL Pattern Recognition

We identify product URLs through several methods:

- **Path analysis**: Looking for common product URL patterns such as:
  - `/product/`
  - `/p/`
  - `/item/`
  - `/products/`
  - `/shop/`
  - Product IDs in URLs (numeric or alphanumeric sequences)

- **URL structure**: Product URLs often have a specific depth and structure
  - Example: `domain.com/category/subcategory/product-name-p12345`

### 2. Content Analysis

When a page is fetched, we analyze its content to determine if it's a product page:

- **Schema.org markup**: Many e-commerce sites use Product schema
- **Open Graph tags**: Looking for `og:type` with value `product`
- **HTML structure**: Product pages typically contain:
  - Price information
  - Add to cart buttons
  - Product descriptions
  - Product images

### 3. Link Filtering

To avoid crawling irrelevant pages, we filter links based on:

- **Blacklisted patterns**: Excluding paths like `/account/`, `/login/`, `/cart/`
- **URL depth**: Limiting the depth of crawling to avoid going too deep into non-product areas
- **Domain restriction**: Only following links within the same domain

### 4. Scalability and Performance

To handle large websites efficiently:

- **Asynchronous processing**: Using `asyncio` and `aiohttp` for concurrent requests
- **Rate limiting**: Implementing delays between requests to avoid overloading servers
- **Distributed crawling**: Ability to distribute crawling across multiple workers

### 5. Validation

To ensure we're correctly identifying product URLs:

- **Sampling**: Manually verifying a sample of discovered URLs
- **Pattern refinement**: Continuously improving pattern recognition based on results

## Site-Specific Strategies

For the required domains, we implement specific strategies:

1. **virgio.com**: 
   - Product URLs follow pattern: `/products/[product-name]`
   - Contains product schema markup

2. **tatacliq.com**:
   - Product URLs follow pattern: `/[category]/[product-name]/p-[product-id]`
   - Uses product schema markup

3. **nykaafashion.com**:
   - Product URLs follow pattern: `/[category]/[product-name]/[product-id]`
   - Contains add-to-cart functionality

4. **westside.com**:
   - Product URLs follow pattern: `/products/[product-name]`
   - Contains product pricing information

By combining these approaches, we can effectively identify product URLs across different e-commerce platforms while maintaining scalability and performance.
